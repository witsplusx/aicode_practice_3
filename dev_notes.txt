我想使用Chakra UI创建一个移动优先的英语学习应用，主要需求点如下：
1、用户为中国环境下的中小学学生
2、提供全方位的测评能力，从听说读写等输出精准用户画像
3、通过用户画像制定学习路线
4、应用提供阶段性周期性测评功能
5、功能引导性强、循序渐进，并融合一些知名的学习方法进去，对应试教育有实质性作用


1、all age range (6-8,8-10,10-12)
2、English learning for Chinese native speakers
3、Primarily at home with parent supervision. Independent learning
4、all of the above
5、CEFR levels (A1, A2, B1, etc.)
6、Communicative language teaching. Task-based learning. Gamification elements.
7、School English exams. International certifications (Cambridge, IELTS, TOEFL Junior)
8、Pre-built curriculum. Integration with existing textbooks.
9、Daily/weekly/monthly reports. Parent/teacher dashboards.
10、Offline capability. Mobile app. Offline capability.
