# PRD: Language Learning App

## Executive Summary

A mobile-first language learning application built with Chakra UI, designed specifically for Chinese elementary students (ages 6-12). The app provides comprehensive assessment capabilities across speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills, generates detailed user profiles using CEFR leveling, and creates personalized learning paths through AI-powered algorithms. The app integrates communicative language teaching, task-based learning, and gamification elements to support both school exam preparation and international certification readiness.

## Problem Statement

Chinese elementary students need a comprehensive, mobile-first English learning solution that provides accurate assessment of all language skills and personalized learning paths. Existing solutions often focus on isolated skills or lack proper integration with established learning methodologies. There's a critical need for an app that can adapt to different age groups (6-8, 8-10, 10-12), provide detailed progress tracking for parents and teachers, and function effectively in both online and offline environments.
