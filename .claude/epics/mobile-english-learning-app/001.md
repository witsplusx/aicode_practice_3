# Task: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Description
Set up the foundational infrastructure for the mobile English learning application including cloud environment, CI/CD pipeline, development environments, and core architectural components.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cloud infrastructure (AWS/Aliyun) provisioned with Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured with automated testing and deployment
- [ ] Development environment setup with Docker containers and local tooling
- [ ] Database clusters (MongoDB, PostgreSQL) configured and optimized
- [ ] API Gateway and service mesh implemented
- [ ] Monitoring and logging infrastructure deployed
- [ ] Security configurations and compliance checks in place
- [ ] CDN and caching infrastructure (Redis) configured

## Technical Details
- **Cloud Architecture**: Kubernetes deployment on AWS/Aliyun with auto-scaling
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform scripts for reproducible environment setup
- **Database Strategy**: MongoDB for user profiles, PostgreSQL for structured data
- **API Management**: API Gateway with rate limiting, authentication, and monitoring
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack for observability
- **Security**: Network security groups, IAM roles, and encryption setup
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or Jenkins pipeline with automated testing

## Dependencies

- [ ] Database licenses and configuration
- [ ] Security certificates and compliance documentation

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: L (Large)
- **Hours**: 80 hours
- **Parallel**: true (can run alongside other foundational tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All infrastructure components deployed and tested
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline successfully building and deploying
- [ ] Development environments functional for team
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation complete and shared
- [ ] Team trained on infrastructure
