# Task: Mobile App UI Components

## Description
Implement React Native UI components for the language learning mobile application, including screens, navigation, and age-appropriate interface elements for users aged 6-10. The components should provide an engaging, child-friendly learning experience with intuitive navigation and responsive design across different mobile device sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Main dashboard screen with lesson progress tracking and achievements
- [ ] Lesson selection screen with age-appropriate visual lesson cards
- [ ] Interactive learning screens with multimedia support (images, audio, text)
- [ ] Progress visualization components showing completion status and rewards
- [ ] Parent dashboard for monitoring child's progress and managing settings
- [ ] Navigation system with tab bar and screen transitions
- [ ] Responsive design supporting various mobile device sizes and orientations
- [ ] Accessibility features including text-to-speech and touch targets
- [ ] Dark/light mode toggle with child-friendly themes
- [ ] Loading states and error handling components

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: React Native with TypeScript and modern component architecture
