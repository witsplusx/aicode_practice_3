# Task: Offline Architecture & Sync

## Description
Design and implement offline-first architecture with robust synchronization capabilities for the language learning application. This includes local storage management, conflict resolution strategies, background sync mechanisms, and seamless offline mode functionality to ensure continuous learning experience regardless of network connectivity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Local database implementation using SQLite/AsyncStorage for offline data storage
- [ ] Offline queue system for storing changes when network is unavailable
- [ ] Background sync service with automatic retry mechanisms
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategy for handling concurrent offline/online edits
- [ ] Network connectivity detection and state management
- [ ] Data synchronization with remote API when connection is restored
- [ ] Offline progress tracking and lesson completion caching
- [ ] User experience for offline mode with appropriate messaging
- [ ] Data consistency validation and integrity checks
- [ ] Performance optimization for large dataset synchronization

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Offline-first architecture with local-first data storage
- Key considerations: Data consistency, battery usage optimization, conflict resolution
- Code locations:
  - `src/storage/` - Local storage and database operations
  - `src/sync/` - Synchronization services and queue management
  - `src/network/` - Network monitoring and connectivity handling
  - `src/services/` - Background services and workers

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Core App Setup
- [ ] Task 002: Database Schema Design
- [ ] Task 003: API Design
- [ ] Task 004: Authentication System
- [ ] Local storage solution (SQLite or AsyncStorage)
- [ ] Background task library (React Native Background Actions)
- [ ] Network monitoring utilities

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L (large)
- Hours: 28
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Local storage implementation fully functional
- [ ] Background sync service working with proper error handling
- [ ] Conflict resolution mechanism tested with various scenarios
- [ ] Network connectivity detection and state management working
- [ ] Offline mode UX implemented with appropriate user feedback
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met for sync operations
- [ ] Data integrity tests passing
- [ ] Battery usage optimization verified
- [ ] Code reviewed and following offline-first best practices
- [ ] Integration tests for sync scenarios
- [ ] Documentation updated with architecture overview
