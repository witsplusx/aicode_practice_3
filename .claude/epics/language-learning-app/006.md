# Task: AI Personalization Service

## Description
Python FastAPI service for learning path optimization and personalized content recommendations. Create an intelligent system that analyzes user performance, learning patterns, and preferences to deliver customized learning experiences.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] FastAPI-based microservice architecture
- [ ] Machine learning model for learning path optimization
- [ ] User behavior analysis and pattern recognition
- [ ] Personalized content recommendation engine
- [ ] Adaptive learning difficulty adjustment
- [ ] Performance prediction and progress forecasting
- [ ] A/B testing framework for personalization strategies
- [ ] Real-time personalization API endpoints

## Technical Details
- Implement FastAPI service with async/await support
- Use scikit-learn/TensorFlow for ML models
- Redis for caching user profiles and recommendations
- PostgreSQL for user behavior data storage
- Message queue (RabbitMQ) for asynchronous processing
- RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
- Model training and deployment pipeline
- Monitoring and logging for personalization effectiveness

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Project Setup and Infrastructure
- [ ] Task 002: Database Schema Design
- [ ] Task 003: Core API Development
- [ ] Task 004: Authentication and User Management
- [ ] ML model training data and pipelines
- [ ] Redis caching infrastructure
- [ ] Message queue setup
- [ ] Model serving infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L (large)
- Hours: 24
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] AI personalization service implemented and tested
- [ ] ML models trained and deployed
- [ ] API endpoints functional with integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (response time < 500ms)
- [ ] Personalization effectiveness validated through A/B tests
- [ ] Documentation for API integration and model usage
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged to main branch
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards operational
