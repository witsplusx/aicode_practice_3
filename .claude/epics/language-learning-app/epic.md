  - Strong ORM support (Prisma/Sequelize)
  - PostgreSQL's JSON support for flexible user profiles
- **AI/ML**: Python FastAPI microservices
  - Access to advanced ML libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
  - Separate service allows independent scaling
  - Python's dominance in AI/ML ecosystem

### Key Architectural Patterns
- **Microservices Architecture**: Separate services for core app, AI processing, and analytics
